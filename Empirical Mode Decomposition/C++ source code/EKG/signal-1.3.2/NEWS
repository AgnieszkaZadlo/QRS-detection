Summary of important user-visible changes for signal 1.3.2:
----------------------------------------------------------

 ** The package is no longer dependent on the general package.

Summary of important user-visible changes for signal 1.3.1:
----------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following window functions now accept a Matlab compatible option
    to select the periodic variant, useful for FFT applications:

      blackmanharris    hann
      blackmannuttall   nuttallwin

 ** The following filter design functions have improved and more consistent
    input parameter validation:

      buttord    cheb2ord
      cheb1ord   ellipord

===============================================================================
signal-1.3.0   Release Date: 2014-01-26   Release Manager: Mike Miller
===============================================================================

 ** The following functions are new:

      digitrevorder   upsamplefill
      primitive       wconv
      ultrwin

 ** Several bugs have been fixed in the following functions:

      ellipord    ifwht
      findpeaks   remez
      fir1        resample
      fwht        schtrig
      grpdelay    zp2sos

 ** Replaced line continuation marker "\" by "..." to avoid deprecated syntax
    warning in Octave 3.8.

 ** The signal package now depends on Octave 3.8 or newer.  The `ellipke'
    function is required, which used to be provided by the specfun package.
    Consequently, the signal package no longer depends on specfun.

===============================================================================
signal-1.2.2   Release Date: 2013-03-25   Release Manager: Mike Miller
===============================================================================

 ** No change release to correct bad file permissions on previous release.

===============================================================================
signal-1.2.1   Release Date: 2013-03-17   Release Manager: Mike Miller
===============================================================================

 ** The following functions are new:

      buttap
      cheb1ap
      cheb2ap
      ellipap
      findpeaks
      fwht
      ifwht

 ** Improved Matlab compatibility for the following window functions:

      barthannwin
      blackmanharris
      blackmannuttall
      chebwin
      flattopwin
      nuttallwin

    The changes include always returning a column vector, returning a valid
    window for a length argument of 1, and making all arguments after the
    length optional.

 ** Minor updates to documentation for the following functions:

      cpsd
      mscohere
      sos2tf
      sos2zp
      tfestimate
      zp2sos


 ** signal is no longer dependent on the optim package.

===============================================================================
signal-1.2.0   Release Date: 2012-09-21   Release Manager: Carnë Draug
===============================================================================

 ** Improved Matlab compability for the function `fir2'. This changes include
    always returning vaues in a row (even when the smoothing window is a single
    column), the default values for grid_n and ramp_n, and returning an error
    when invalid values are used (instead of silently adjusting them).

 ** Fixed failing tests for the following functions:

      fir1      pei_tseng_notch     residued

 ** The function `rceps' was fixed to work correctly with odd-length inputs.

 ** Bugfix in `xcorr2' introduced in 1.1.2 that would not accept "none" as
    scale option.

 ** `xcorr2' scaling option "coeff" was changed to return the normalized
    cross-correlation.

 ** The following functions are new:

      movingrms     schtrig     clustersegment

 ** signal is no longer dependent on the image package.

 ** signal is now dependent on the general package.

===============================================================================
signal-1.1.3   Release Date: 2012-05-12   Release Manager: Carnë Draug
===============================================================================

 ** signal is no longer dependent on the audio package.

 ** signal is now dependent on the image package.

 ** The function `marcumq' was imported from the communications package and has
    been completely rewritten to improve performance and fix computational
    errors.

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.

 ** The functions `__ellip_ws' and `__ellip_ws_min' have been removed (they
    are now subfunctions of `ncauer'.

 ** The function `blackmanharris' was fixed to have even symmetry.

===============================================================================
signal-1.1.2   Release Date: 2012-01-06   Release Manager: Lukas Reichlin
===============================================================================

 * Added the following filter conversion functions:
    ss2tf
    ss2zp
    tf2ss
    tf2zp
    zp2ss
    zp2tf

===============================================================================
